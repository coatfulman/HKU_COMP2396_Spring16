# HKU_COMP2396_Spring16

Two fun course projects that I think worth uploading. 

For the AS3, assignment design needs students to design complicated OOP program, which leaves me good skills about OOP.

For the AS4, I used naive implementation of parallel socket programming in JAVA. Not untill I took CS241 in UIUC, I didn't realized how naive I was.

All the course projects come with no starter code, needing student to design all of it.
